**Galaxy in Research: Advancing quantum materials research with Galaxy**
========================================================================


*At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, scientists have harnessed the power of Galaxy to bring together cutting\-edge computing resources, paving the way for new discoveries in quantum materials through advanced neutron scattering data analysis.*


**Research Overview**
---------------------


Understanding the behavior of correlated quantum materials involves intricate data analysis and sophisticated computational methods. Traditional approaches, such as density functional theory and linear spin\-wave theory, often need to catch up in capturing the complexities of strong electron\-electron interactions and localized electronic states. To address these challenges, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) utilized advanced methods like dynamical mean\-field theory (DMFT) and the dynamic cluster approximation (DCA) implemented in ORNL‚Äôs DCA\+\+ code.


The study focused on neutron scattering data analysis for quantum materials, which is crucial for revealing the magnetic excitations of these systems. By integrating Galaxy with high\-performance computing (HPC) and cloud resources, the research team developed a fully automated end\-to\-end workflow to streamline this complex analysis.


**Key Findings**
----------------


* **Advanced Computational Approach**: The team used DMFT and DCA methods to model correlated quantum materials, providing a detailed and accurate description of magnetic excitations.
* **Workflow Automation:** The integration of Galaxy allowed for the automation of the DCA\+\+ workflow, reducing the need for manual intervention and facilitating reproducibility.
* **Resource Efficiency:** The workflow used HPC and cloud\-based resources, demonstrating flexibility and scalability in handling large datasets and complex calculations.
* **Scientific Impact:** The final results, including a comprehensive analysis of dynamic magnetic spin susceptibility, offer valuable insights into quantum materials, with potential implications for future neutron scattering experiments.

**Galaxy's Role**
-----------------


Galaxy played a significant role in the success of this study, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the neutron data analysis workflow. Here‚Äôs how Galaxy contributed:


* **Workflow Integration:** Galaxy enabled the seamless integration of the DCA\+\+ code into a comprehensive workflow. By creating custom tools and defining input/output requirements in XML files, Galaxy managed the data transfer and execution processes, ensuring smooth operation across different computational resources.
* **Data Management:** Galaxy‚Äôs integration with the Rucio object store allowed for efficient data handling, keeping large files local to their computational resources and avoiding unnecessary transfers.
* **Automated Execution:** Galaxy automated the workflow, eliminating manual steps and allowing researchers to run complex simulations with just a few clicks. This automation extended to the end\-to\-end execution, from initial convergence calculations to final result plotting.
* **Scalability and Flexibility:** Galaxy‚Äôs versatility in handling HPC and cloud\-based resources is demonstrated by its workflow, which adapts to varying resource requirements, including large\-scale computations on Frontier and post\-processing on virtual machines.


**Significance of the Study**
-----------------------------


This study showcases the transformative power of combining Galaxy with advanced computational techniques. By automating and streamlining complex data analysis workflows, the researchers achieved significant scientific results and set a precedent for future studies in quantum materials. The integration of Galaxy into this process underscores its potential to address intricate scientific problems efficiently and reproducibly.
